# task_stimuli_emul

Basic emulator of the `task_stimuli` framework from the [Courtois NeuroMod Project](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod).

Run `python main.py 2> std.log` (Linux) for saving logs in file and not displaying them in terminal (recommended).

**WARNING**: this part of the repository makes use of PyGame and was meant to simulate a `task-stimuli`-like structure; it does *not* make use of PsychoPy but can be used to control Cozmo *e.g.* from a laptop.  

For a **PsychoPy** alternative, please see the *psychopy_version* branch of this repository.
